refresh tokens shouldnt be passed in the body. postman is complaining
a deleted user is still able to login. FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY!!!
add documentation for regular users trying to do admin level tasks
ensure only resource owners can delete or update
rewrite documentation and set it to live server
add @ to all the routes requiring user handles
