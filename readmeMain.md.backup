# Postit Social Media App
=======================================


Build a simple social media app called Postit (or Post-it). Post-it allows you to post anything (text, images, video, and/or audio) on a single post-it. A post-it is a single post on the post-it app, just like a tweet. Other users can reply to a post-it. Replying to a post-it is like adding a comment to a post (post-it). A post-it reply can also be one or a combination of text and other media already mentioned. To simplify things, a post-it and its replies can just be text for now.
